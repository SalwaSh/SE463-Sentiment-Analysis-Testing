# Sentiment Analysis üòÑüìä

<p align="justify">
Our sentiment analysis software is a simple simulation for natural language processing 
technique that uses several if condition statements to automatically classify the 
sentiment of a given text into positive, negative, or neutral categories


The purpose of this project is to demonstrate our knowledge of Software Testing and 
Quality Assurance. To accomplish this, we will be utilizing dynamic testing as one of 
our testing techniques to measure code coverage. We will design our test plans, create 
test suites, and perform test coverage both manually and automatically. To compare the 
results, we will evaluate test suite coverage using the well-known "Coverage.py" library 
in Python. All of these concepts will be done side by side with improving our abilities 
to operate well as team players or leaders. Also, we will present the outcomes of the 
testing and quality assurance audit in a professional manner, both orally and in writing 
form.
